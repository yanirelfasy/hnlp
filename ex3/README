README!
Two python files:
1. data_loader.py
2. ex3.py

----------------------
data_loader.py :
    As given by the course.
    2 methods were added to SentimentTreeNode class:
    1. def get_rare_word_test_set(self):
        return: list of Sentence instances,with rare words, for the test part of the dataset
    2. get_neg_word_test_set(self)
        return: list of Sentence instances,with negative words, for the test part of the dataset
ex3.py:
    implementation of all the classes and function the course gave.
    Additional fields,methods and functions:

    Under training functions:
        1. def run_model_W2V()
        2. def run_model_one_hot()
        3. def run_model_LSTM()
        These functions just run the differents models with the TEST and special subsets.

    In DataManager class we added 2 fields:
        1. self.sentences[RARE]
        2. self.sentences[NEG]
        same as the VAL, TEST and TRAINING. This time for the negative words in test and rare words in test.
        Now we can create a iterator for this subsets too.

     We did not implemented
        def get_predictions_for_data(model, data_iter).
        We did not needed it. Thanks.
